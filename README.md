### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
Software Engineer / UX Engineer, entrepreneur, and product strategist. Proud student at Hive (https://hive.fi/).

Passionate learner and product-enthusiast, who loves to create products loved by humans, backed by research and driven by principles.

In my free time you can find me frisbee golfing, bouldering, playing board games and writing on the Futurish newsletter, and learning more about machine learning.

Also, a 100% sci-fi nerd (currently reading Hyperion - The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons) and a C language fanboy.
